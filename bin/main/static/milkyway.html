    <h2>The Milkyway Galaxy</h2>

    <p>
      The Milky Way Galaxy is most significant to humans because it is home
      sweet home. But when it comes down to it, our galaxy is a typical barred
      spiral, much like billions of other galaxies in the universe. Let's take a

    <h3>Location, location, location</h3>
    <p>
      A glance up at the night sky reveals a broad swath of light. Described by
      the ancients as a river, as milk, and as a path, among other things, the
      band has been visible in the heavens since Earth first formed. In reality,
      this intriguing line of light is the center of our galaxy, as seen from
      one of its outer arms.
